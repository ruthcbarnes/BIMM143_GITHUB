# Structural Bioinformatics

## 1. Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

### The PDB Database & PDB Statistics

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called PDB found at https://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Experimental Method and Molecular Type.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

***Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.***

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric. I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing, "" with the `sub()` function:

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
as.numeric( sub(",", "", x) )
```

```{r}
sum(as.numeric( sub(",", "", x) ))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function.

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them. 
```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```
```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```
***The percentage of structures in the PDB that are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy are the following:***

**Percent of X-ray structures**
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray) / sum(df$total) * 100
```

**Percent of EM structures**
```{r}
sum(df$em) / sum(df$total) * 100
```

***Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?***

```{r}
sum(df[1,8])/sum(df$total)
```

***Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?***

Around 131 HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB.

## 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

### Using Mol* and The important role of water

The main Mol* homepage at https://molstar.org/viewer/
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code).

***Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?***

For simplification purposes and to show that bonding is only to the oxygen part of the water molecule rather than the whole molecule.

![Surface represntation showing binding](1HSG.1.png)

***Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have.***

![Water 308 in the binding site](1HSG.2.png)

***Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.***

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

### Reading PDB file data into R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

***Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?***

198

or 

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

***Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?***

HOH

***Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?***

2 chains A and B

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")`

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink") 
```

### Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```


## 4. Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase

***Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?***

Msa is a package that is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN.

***Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?:***

Bio3d-view is a package not found on BioConductor or CRAN.

***Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?***

True, functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket

***Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?***

214 amino acids are in this sequence.
